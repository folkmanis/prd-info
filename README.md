# PrdInfo

Self-learning project with the aim of improving knowledge in Javascript and explore Typescript and Angular while making something useful.

This is the front-end part that requires access to REST API https://github.com/folkmanis/prd-info-node

## A Demo

There is a demo server running at [https://demo.folkmanis.id.lv/](https://demo.folkmanis.id.lv/), user: demo, password: demo

## A Learning Project

This is my first attempt to make useful web-application by learning Javascript, Typescript, full-stack development etc.

As a complete noob in modern programming, I had no knowledge about test-driven approach at start. So, sorry, there is no tests written for this project. It's mainly because the whole project structure must be changed and re-written from scratch to write proper tests.

## In Production

I'm using this app by myself for everyday jobs accounting, invoicing and some other functions like managing some old archive database and retriewing attachments from gmail.
